I'm a PhD-candidate in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. My research focuses on the neural systems of small organisms, which I use as a model to advance our understanding in computational neuroscience. I combine both traditional and modern computational approaches with frontier neuroscientific discoveries. I have an interest in biotechnology, especially in areas of natural computing and bioinformatics. I also mentor, with a special emphasis on supporting under-represented minorities in STEM. I'm open to collaborations.

Current Research Interest
======
I study the neural system of _C. elegans_, an organism with only 300 neurons, to understand how even simple nervous systems interact with the environment to produce complex behavior. This research aims to enhance our knowledge in neuroscience and may have potential applications to signal processing, control theory and artificial intelligence.

Background and History
======
Before starting my PhD at MIT, I completed a B.Sc. in Computation and Cognition from the same institution. I grew up in St. Lucia.

Non-academic Interests
======
Outside of academia, I enjoy reading fiction and hiking. I also enjoy traveling when possible, with a keen interest in understanding different cultures.
