This essay argues that the assumption of a single unified world is not just incomplete—it actively distorts how we think, build, and reason about reality.

Worlds, in this framework, are **agent-relative**: defined not by what exists, but by what a given actor can directly observe and interact with. The macroscopic physical world, the digital world, the microscopic world, the cosmos, and the world of abstract thought are not "views of the same thing"—they are distinct domains with different logic, different relevant variables, and different demands.

The essay draws on Penrose's three-world model, reinterprets Plato's allegory of the cave, and makes explicit distinctions between multi-worldedness and both the sci-fi multiverse and multimodality.
