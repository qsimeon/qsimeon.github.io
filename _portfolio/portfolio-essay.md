## Multimodal Alignment and Platonic Representation

This essay explores a fundamental question in deep learning: How can we align disparate pre-trained neural networks into shared multimodal representations that preserve the semantic structure of their individual specializations?

### Key Insights

The research investigates how:
- Vision transformers and language models encode information in structurally different ways
- Shared embedding spaces can facilitate cross-modal understanding
- Platonic representations offer a theoretical framework for thinking about universal representations
