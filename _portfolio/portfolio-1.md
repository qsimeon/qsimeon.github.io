Thankful for this [Graduate Research Spotlight](https://lnkd.in/enKfwVEQ) in the latest issue of [The Bridge by IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu](https://magazines.ieee.org/hkn/library/page/issue_2_2024/1/). My best attempt at a layman's explanation of one of my ongoing research projects. If this sounds interesting to you, let's collaborate!
