In 2025, I was awarded an **Honorable Mention** in the [Envisioning the Future of Computing Prize, MIT SERC](https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/envisioning-the-future-of-computing-prize-home/envisioning-the-future-of-computing-prize-2025-winners/). The competition, hosted by MIT's Schwarzman College of Computing, received 67 highly competitive entries across multiple departments.

My submission, entitled [*The Future of Computing Was Inside You All Along: Integrating Your Life‚Äôs Blueprint with Your Digital Fingerprint*](https://computing.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Future-of-Computing-Was-Inside-You-All-Along.pdf), explores speculative but ethically grounded futures for digital identity, where behavioral and neural data could be securely and responsibly integrated to augment our personal computing systems.

This recognition came with a $1,000 prize and publication on the MIT SERC website. The essay was praised for its blend of scientific realism and long-term imagination around responsible neurodata use.
