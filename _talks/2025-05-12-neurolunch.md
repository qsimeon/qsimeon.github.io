This talk explores how the nematode *C. elegans* presents an opportunity for integrating multiple dimensions of neural function. With only 302 neurons, complete connectome mapping, optical transparency, and genetic tractability, *C. elegans* enables comprehensive study across three fundamental modalities: molecular genetic profiles, network connectivity, and neural activity dynamics.

I discuss recent technological advances allowing whole-nervous-system measurements of these modalities, computational frameworks for their integration, and propose approaches to overcome current limitations in multimodal data acquisition and integration.
